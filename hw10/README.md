I have added a PDF file where you can see the milestones of the project.

I used one sensor. During recording, the temperature has not changed. There are no obvious findings. I ran the program for about 15 minutes.
I've added images and the link to the data sheet.

The optional task did not work. I added a picture with the error message.

Professor Yoder's Comments

Your code doesn't appear to have a loop that will keep recording the temp.
Did you try putting your figure on the sensor to see if the temp will change?
Milestones look good.  Your dates are out of order.
I'd like you to demo this to me showing it responding to temp changes before
giving you more points.
