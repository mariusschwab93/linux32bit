In this file you can see the answers for the Measuring a gpio. The table 
is showing the results with the diagrams of the period/frequenc.

1) Sleeptime = 0.1  U_max= 4.22V  U_min= 3.41V freq= 4.18HZ

2) Period is 4.18 HZ

3) It is 6 HZ close to 100ms

4)The differ is the result of the work from another parallel
  prozesses.  

5) The are using 1 to 3 prozessors, 31 Tasks and 60 Threads

6) look at the table in the excel file

7) The period is not stable. So it have some changes. At the ./togglegpio.s 
   it is like a exp-function

8) The period has now 4.3HZ.

9) 

10) No changes

11) The maxiumum is 30HZ. Than the CPU is at the maximum of 100%.
