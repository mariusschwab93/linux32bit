fourGPIO.py:
Here you can push four buttons. Ech button could power on one LED.
LED1=>P9_11 power on Button1=>P9_15
LED2=>P9_12 power on Button2=>P9_16
LED3=>P9_13 power on Button3=>P9_17
LED4=>P9_14 power on Button4=>P9_18

Measurment the GPIO:

The answers of this you can read in the .txt-File the tables are listing 
in the Excel-Table and in the PDF. I also added a screenshot of the oszilloscop I have it done together with Vinzenz Felder. 


etchasketchGPIO.py:

At first you must say a size of the screen. Be sure, that the size of the 
screen is not to large or to small.

Now you can play the game with four Buttons.
Button1: go up ->P9_15
Button2: go down ->P9_16
Button3: go left ->P9_17
Button4: go right ->P9_18

with "c" you can clear the screen. With q use the quit.

Looks good.  The plots are a nice touch, but be sure to label the axis.
