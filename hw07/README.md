We created a Projekt Template on eLinux. 
https://elinux.org/ECE497_Project_-_Camper_Automation 

At first run install.sh with "./install.sh". 

I added a picture  that shows how the Blynk is running.

With the leds.js you can push a LED on the Beagle from your smartphone on
and off. The smartohone communicate with the Beagle over server or router. 

With the server_leds.js you use the duty_cycle. You can dim the LED on the 
Beagle from your Mobilephone. For this LED I use the PIN9_14.
