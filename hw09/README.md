In the folder 2.6 Blinking an LED and 05blocks you find the code to run. In the PDF-file you find the resolution of the mMeasurement

2.6 Blinking an LED
For this exercise you have to run the hello.c. With the comand 
"bone$ source setup.sh" and "bone$ make". With the oscilloscope you can measure the signal (see PDF-Filfe). 

5.3 PWM Generator
For this exercise you find the code in folder 05blocks. You run the code pwm1.c with the comands "bone$ config-pin P9_27 pruout", 
"bone$ export PRUN=0" ,"bone$ export TARGET=pwm1" and "bone$ make". 

5.4 Controlling the PWM Frequency 
For this exercise you find the code in folder 05blocks. You run the code pwm4.c with the comands "bone$ config-pin P8_43 pruout",
"bone$ config-pin P8_44 pruout","bone$ config-pin P8_45 pruout","bone$ config-pin P8_46 pruout", "bone$ export PRUN=1" ,
"bone$ export TARGET=pwm4" and "bone$ make".

5.5 Loop Unrolling for Better Performance
For this exercise you find the code in folder 05blocks. You run the code pwm5.c with the comands "bone$ export TARGET=pwm5" 
and "bone$ make". 

5.9. Reading an Input at Regular Intervals
For this exercise you find the code in folder 05blocks. You run the code pwm5.c with the comands "bone$ source input_setup.sh"
 and "bone$ make".
